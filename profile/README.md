# `@this-project` Organizations

Sometimes, you may need an empty npm organization (or Docker organization) for non-npm projects, to prevent name conflict with real package/image.

I have access to both the `@this-project` npm organization and the `thisproject` Docker organization. I will not publish any package or image under these organizations.

Feel free to use the `@this-project` scope for your non-npm projects and the `thisproject` Docker organization for your container-related projects!
